Problem 4

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun,
a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a
story that you create.

Example Output:

Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: walk
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quickly
Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!

Constraints:

• Use a single output statement for this program.
• If your language supports string interpolation or string
substitution, use it to build up the output.
