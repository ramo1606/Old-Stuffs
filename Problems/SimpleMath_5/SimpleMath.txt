Problem 6

Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Print the
sum, difference, product, and quotient of those numbers as
shown in the example output:

Example Output:

What is the first number? 10
What is the second number? 5
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
10 * 5 = 50
10 / 5 = 2

Constraints:
• Values coming from users will be strings. Ensure that
you convert these values to numbers before doing the
math.
• Keep the inputs and outputs separate from the numerical
conversions and other processing.
• Generate a single output statement with line breaks in
the appropriate spots.
